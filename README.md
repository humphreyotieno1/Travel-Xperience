## Challenge
1. Problem to Solve:
The Portfolio Project aims to simplify and enhance the travel planning process for individuals and families by providing a centralized platform for researching destinations, comparing prices, and making bookings. Traditional methods of planning a trip can be time-consuming and overwhelming, leading to frustration for travelers.

2. What the Portfolio Project Will Not Solve:
While the project streamlines travel planning, it will not address external factors like travel restrictions or provide real-time updates on emergencies. Users must still stay informed about relevant travel advisories and regulations.

## Users and Audience
- The Portfolio Project caters to leisure travelers, business travelers, families, and travel enthusiasts seeking personalized recommendations, curated travel packages, and seamless booking experiences.

- Relevance to Locale: While designed for global accessibility, certain features may be more relevant to specific locales or cultural contexts. However, the project's core functionality remains universally applicable, adaptable to diverse locales and travel preferences.

## Risks
1. Technical Risks: Dependency on External APIs: Potential impact on service interruptions or inaccurate information.
2. Scalability Issues: Impact on slow response times, system crashes, or downtime.
## Non-Technical Risks:
1. Legal and Compliance Issues: Impact on legal disputes, fines, or lawsuits.
2. Market Competition: Impact on difficulty in gaining traction, acquiring users, and generating revenue.
